            <h2>What is a Set?</h2>
            <p>Objective: The goal is to find as many sets of three cards as possible from a collection of twelve cards.</p>
            <p>A Set is a group of three cards where the cards either all share the same or all have different values for that feature.</p>
            <p>Whenever you find a set, click on your three cards.</p>
            <p>The player's turn will switch if they correctly identify a set or a minute has passed.</p>
            <p>If you get stuck, you can click on the “Hint” button, which will reveal two cards in a matching set.</p>
            <p>The game ends when there are no sets on the board and the player with the most sets in the end wins!</p>
